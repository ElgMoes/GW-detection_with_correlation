## Using Correlation to detect Gravitational Waves - Abstract
A gravitational wave is a wave that is caused by two heavy stellar objects orbiting each other. Analysing gravitational waves (GWs) results in a greater understanding of numerous events in the universe, such as colliding black holes and neutron stars. Several studies focus on the analysis of gravitational waves and add valuable knowledge to this field of scientific research. This paper contributes to these studies by giving an overview of which computational techniques allow to detect gravitational waves in noisy data. This will be done by naming important theoretical concepts, like correlation, arrays and gravitational waves, and explaining the use of them. There will be a description of a program written in Python code to prove the workings of these concepts. We will then show the correlation graphs our program creates and review graphs from the programs we wrote to test the average correlation at different signal to noise ratios (SNR) and the probability of a significant detection at different SNRs, which both show a positive relation between the two values. Our conclusion is that we definitely can detect gravitational waves in noisy data using correlation and even calculate the chance of a signal being a wave. This paper, however, does not explore other techniques such as Fourier analysis. More precisely, the purpose of our program is limited to finding gravitational waves, it detects no further information about the waves themselves.
